	independently reproduce the results they present. ''Everything''

	approach is presented first, starting with what economists have been
	calling replication since the early eighties to end with what is
	now called reproducible research in computational data analysis oriented
	fields like statistics and signal processing. Since efficient tools
	are instrumental for a routine implementation of these approaches,
	a description of some of the available ones is presented next. A
	toy example demonstrates then the use of two open source software
	for reproducible data analysis: the ''Sweave family'' and the org-mode
	of emacs. The former is bound to R while the latter can be used with
	R, Matlab, Python and many more ''generalist'' data processing software.
	Both solutions can be used with Unix-like, Windows and Mac families

	data recorded from Purkinje cells (PCs) in young rat cerebellar slices.
	This algorithm is unique in its capability to estimate and make use
	of the firing statistics as well as the spike amplitude dynamics
	of the recorded neurons. PCs exhibit multiple discharge states, giving
	rise to multimodal interspike interval (ISI) histograms and to correlations
	between successive ISIs. The amplitude of the spikes generated by
	a PC in an "active" state decreases, a feature typical of many neurons
	from both vertebrates and invertebrates. These two features constitute
	a major and recurrent problem for all the presently available spike-sorting
	methods. We first show that a Hidden Markov Model with 3 log-Normal
	states provides a flexible and satisfying description of the complex
	firing of single PCs. We then incorporate this model into our previous
	MCMC based spike-sorting algorithm (Pouzat et al, 2004, J. Neurophys.
	91, 2910-2928) and test this new algorithm on multi-unit recordings
	of bursting PCs. We show that our method successfully classifies
	the bursty spike trains fired by PCs by using an independent single
	unit recording from a patch-clamp pipette.},

The two channel amplitude ratio will remain constant regardless of intrinsic variation in the absolute amplitude of the signals. The method has been applied to the rat hippocampal formation, from which up to 5 units have been simultaneously isolated. The construction of the electrodes is simple, relatively fast, and reliable, and their low tip impedances result in excellent signal to noise characteristics. ",

	abstract = {Spike-sorting techniques attempt to classify a series of noisy electrical
	waveforms according to the identity of the neurons that generated
	them. Existing techniques perform this classification ignoring several
	properties of actual neurons that can ultimately improve classification
	performance. In this study, we propose a more realistic spike train
	generation model. It incorporates both a description of "nontrivial"
	(i.e., non-Poisson) neuronal discharge statistics and a description
	of spike waveform dynamics (e.g., the events amplitude decays for
	short interspike intervals). We show that this spike train generation
	model is analogous to a one-dimensional Potts spin-glass model. We
	can therefore tailor to our particular case the computational methods
	that have been developed in fields where Potts models are extensively
	used, including statistical physics and image restoration. These
	methods are based on the construction of a Markov chain in the space
	of model parameters and spike train configurations, where a configuration
	is defined by specifying a neuron of origin for each spike. This
	Markov chain is built such that its unique stationary density is
	the posterior density of model parameters and configurations given
	the observed data. A Monte Carlo simulation of the Markov chain is
	then used to estimate the posterior density. We illustrate the way
	to build the transition matrix of the Markov chain with a simple,
	but realistic, model for data generation. We use simulated data to
	illustrate the performance of the method and to show that this approach
	can easily cope with neurons firing doublets of spikes and/or generating
	spikes with highly dynamic waveforms. The method cannot automatically
	find the "correct" number of neurons in the data. User input is required
	for this important problem and we illustrate how this can be done.
	We finally discuss further developments of the method.},
